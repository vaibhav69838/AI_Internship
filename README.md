Project Name:- Traffic sign classification by Vaibhav Jakhar
Description:- In my project i am building a deep neural model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.
I have used Google colab for training my model.
Resnet is the networking model on which i have worked.
Flatten, softmax and dense function are used.
An image generator is made to modify the images.
I have generated train data set and test data set
I have made the batch size of 32 images and 16 images respectively at one time 
There are 39209 images in train frame and 12630 images in test frame
I have used the class mode to be categorical which classify each one of them
